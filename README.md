Objective
1. Facilitate Animal Identification – Allow users to search for different species, including mammals, reptiles, birds, and more.
2. Enhance Learning Through Image Recognition – Enable users to scan or upload pictures of animals and receive instant species identification results
3. Provide Real-Time Population Insights – Utilize geolocation APIs to display animal population data and their distribution across different regions.
4. Knowledge Testing: To offer engaging quizzes that test and enhance users' knowledge about animals and their behaviour, making learning fun and interactive.
5. Promote Wildlife Awareness – Encourage users to engage with and learn about global biodiversity, fostering interest in wildlife conservation.
6. Ensure a User-Friendly Experience – Develop an intuitive and efficient interface for seamless exploration and discovery of animal species.

Summary
- WildWatch is an interactive app that helps users discover and learn about different animal species. Users can search for mammals, reptiles, birds, and other animals. The app also uses image recognition technology, allowing users to scan or upload pictures to identify animals easily. In addition, a geolocation API helps users check where certain animals live and their population in different areas. This app also includes fun quizzes to test knowledge about animal behaviors, habitats, and unique traits.
With a simple and user-friendly design, WildWatch is a great tool for nature lovers, students, and researchers. The app makes learning about wildlife fun and easy while encouraging people to care for and protect animals. By using technology for animal identification and tracking, WildWatch helps users connect with nature in an exciting way.

About this project
- This project is continuous FYP project with one of our team member. The app's functionality is built around several core features. The main feature of the app is the ability to detect animals by scanning or uploading pictures. Using image recognition technology, users can either take a photo with their device's camera or upload an existing image, and the app will analyze it to identify the species.
The app also includes a geolocation feature powered by a geocoding API, which allows users to flag and view animal locations on a map. This feature helps users understand where specific species are commonly found and track their populations. The population tracker provides real-time data on animal populations, highlighting endangered species and raising awareness about conservation efforts.
The app includes an animal trivia section with quizzes and challenges that test users' knowledge about animals, their behaviors, and unique traits. 

Our project member consist of 3 people and each has its own tasks.
1. Syahin - Image Recognition and Animal Detection, Animal discovery
2. Zikry - Animal Quiz, design and implement quiz
3. Fadhilah - Geolocation, Population Tracker, and Trivia

We use Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration. Each member work on their own branch and merge changes into the main branch after testing. For running the app, 'Run flutter pub get' to install dependencies then 'flutter run' to test the app on a connected device or emulator.

Flow of the app:
1. on the home page, the screen will display the history, cateogories of the animals and provide access for discovery and scan animal picture 
2. on the bottom page, there is scanner feature where user can scan using camera or upload animal picture. The app will analyzes the image and provides details about the species.
3. quiz feature where users can test their knowledge about animals. Trivia questions about various animal behaviors, facts, and unique traits are presented, making learning fun and interactive. 
4. When user click on the flag location, the screen will display  the location of an animal’s population on the map. This feature enables users to track where a particular species is found geographically. 

Below is the snapshots result of the app:
